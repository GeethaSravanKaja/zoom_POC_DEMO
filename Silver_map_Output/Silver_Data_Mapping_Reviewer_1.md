# Executive Summary
This document reviews the Silver Layer Data Mapping (Bronze → Silver) for the Zoom Platform Analytics System in Snowflake. The review covers correctness, efficiency, and compliance with Snowflake standards, ensuring all business and technical requirements are met.

# Methodology
The review was conducted by evaluating the Silver Layer Data Mapping output, checking each mapping for Snowflake SQL compliance, validation rule coverage, transformation logic, and alignment with business requirements. Each section below provides detailed findings with ✅ for correct implementations and ❌ for issues or gaps.

# Findings
## 3.1 Data Consistency
✅ All Bronze Layer fields are mapped to Silver Layer destinations with explicit validation rules (e.g., Not null, Unique, Domain checks).
✅ Referential integrity is checked for all foreign keys (e.g., user_id, meeting_id, host_id).
❌ No physical constraints enforced in Snowflake; relies on DQ pipeline logic.

## 3.2 Transformations
✅ Transformations use Snowflake SQL functions (CAST, LOWER, TRIM, etc.) and are clearly documented.
✅ Derived fields (e.g., load_date, update_date) use correct CAST logic.
✅ Email normalization (lowercase, trim) is applied.
❌ No explicit handling for edge-case transformations (e.g., invalid timestamps, string truncation).

## 3.3 Validation Rules
✅ All mandatory fields have Not null checks.
✅ Domain checks are present for plan_type, feature_name, ticket_type, resolution_status, license_type, event_type.
✅ Referential integrity is validated via JOIN logic in DQ pipelines.
✅ Range checks for duration_minutes, registrants, usage_count, amount.
❌ No explicit validation for string length or unexpected values outside documented domains.

## 3.4 Compliance with Best Practices (Snowflake)
✅ Metadata columns (load_date, update_date, source_system) are present in all tables.
✅ Use of supported Snowflake data types and SQL functions.
✅ Audit and error tables are included for traceability.
✅ Recommendations for using Streams and Tasks for error/audit logging.
❌ No mention of clustering/micro-partitioning strategies for large tables.
❌ No explicit masking or secure handling of PII fields (e.g., email).

## 3.5 Business Requirements Alignment
✅ Mapping covers all business rules and reporting requirements as described in the initial recommendations.
✅ SQL examples provided for each validation rule.
❌ No explicit mapping for edge-case business rules (e.g., handling of deleted users, retroactive changes).

## 3.6 Error Handling and Logging
✅ All failed validations are logged in si_error_data with error type, description, source table, and timestamp.
✅ Pipeline executions are logged in si_audit for traceability.
✅ Recommendations for automated error/audit logging using Snowflake features.
❌ No explicit logic for retrying failed loads or handling partial failures.

## 3.7 Effective Data Mapping
✅ All Bronze Layer fields are mapped to Silver Layer with clear transformation and validation logic.
✅ Derived fields are correctly calculated.
❌ No explicit mapping for fields that may be deprecated or added in future versions.

## 3.8 Data Quality
✅ High-quality data ensured by comprehensive validation and transformation rules.
✅ SQL examples provided for automated DQ checks.
❌ No explicit checks for duplicate records across tables (e.g., duplicate meetings or users).

# Reviewer Output Structure

- Executive Summary
- Methodology
- Findings (sections 3.1–3.8)

# Recommendations
1. Consider adding clustering/micro-partitioning strategies for large tables to improve query performance.
2. Implement masking or secure handling for PII fields (e.g., email) in accordance with Snowflake security best practices.
3. Add explicit logic for edge-case business rules and error handling (e.g., retry logic, partial load failures).
4. Document lineage for future schema changes and deprecated fields.
5. Expand validation rules to cover string length, unexpected values, and duplicate records.

# Audit Table Review
✅ Audit table tracks execution_id, pipeline_name, start/end time, status, error_message, load/update date, and source_system.
✅ Sufficient for tracking metadata for each load.
❌ No explicit linkage between audit and error tables for failed records.

# Data Lineage Documentation
✅ Mapping includes end-to-end lineage from Bronze → Silver for all tables.
❌ No explicit lineage for error and audit tables to downstream reporting layers.

# Null Handling and Edge Cases
✅ All mandatory fields have Not null checks.
✅ Default values and logic for derived fields are present.
❌ No explicit logic for handling missing optional fields or exceptional conditions (e.g., future-dated timestamps).

# Conclusion
The Silver Layer Data Mapping for the Zoom Platform Analytics System is robust, Snowflake-compliant, and covers most business and technical requirements. Minor gaps exist in clustering, PII handling, edge-case logic, and lineage documentation. Addressing these will further strengthen the solution.
